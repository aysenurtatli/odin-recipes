    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade salmon roll made with sushi rice, nori, and smoked salmon. This is a very basic and easy recipe for making sushi. It might take a while to learn how to make a perfect roll, but you'll have fun trying! Add wasabi (Japanese horseradish) for a good kick!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sushi rice</li>
        <li>Rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Seaweed</li>
        <li>Wasabi paste</li>
        <li>Smoked salmon</li>
        <li>Cucumber</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</li>
        <li>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</li>
        <li>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed.</li>
        <li>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls.</li>
